# Basic of NumPy

Data science projects frequently use basic Numpy functions in the projects, which can be found in this file.

Two files have been added, **Numpy Basics.ipynb & Numpy Basics.py.** They both **contain the same information.**


## Numpy
NumPy is a library for scientific computations in Python.Numpy is one of the packages you have to know if you're going to do data science with Python.

It is a Python library that provides **support for large, multidimensional arrays along with masked arrays and matrices**, and **provides extensive functions for performing array manipulation, including mathematical, logical, and shape calculations, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms,linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulations,** and so on.
